POSIX:

man setsockopt:


   ``SO_SNDLOWAT is an option to set the minimum count for output operations.
     Most output operations process all of the data supplied by the call, de-
     livering data to the protocol for transmission and blocking as necessary
     for flow control.  Nonblocking output operations will process as much da-
     ta as permitted subject to flow control without blocking, but will pro-
     cess no data if flow control does not allow the smaller of the low water
     mark value or the entire request to be processed.  A select(2) operation
     testing the ability to write to a socket will return true only if the low
     water mark amount could be processed.  The default value for SO_SNDLOWAT
     is set to a convenient size for network efficiency, often 1024.''


However, even tho the man pages in Linux mention this SO_SNDLOWAT doesn't
seem to be available anywhere in its include files. How do I set Low Water
Mark on Linux? This code currently has a crude fix for it but this really
slows down the server.

Ok, I have temporarily fixed things by allocating even more memory, thanks
to Linux, things should work fine now, even though Linux will have to do 
twice as much work.
