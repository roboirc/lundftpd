LundFTPD-2.5 and onward now supports SRP ciphers for both control and
data- sessions. To add SRP to your build of LundFTPD you need to get
the SRP package (1.4.4 at the time of this document) and place it
adjacent to your LundFTPD directory.

Like so:

drwxr-xr-x   5 lundman  admin     512 Apr 20 14:42 lundftpd-2.5
drwxr-xr-x  16 lundman  admin    1024 Mar 27 16:12 srp-1.4.4

and compile SRP. The libraries required are: srp, gmp and krypto. The
rest is not required. (To compile SRP you'll also need to get gmp
library for it - follow the instructions).

Pick you Makefile best suitable for your system and add (or
uncomment):

------- cut cut --------
#
# SRP - Encryption of network traffic
#
DEFINES+= -DSRP -I../../srp-1.4.4/include
LDPATH += -L../../srp-1.4.4/lib
LIBS   += -lsrp -lgmp -lkrypto
------- cut cut --------

near the end, but before the final "include" statement.

Now compile.




Use SRP's "tconf" utility to create your master-key, I recommend
atleast 1024 bits. Also create an empty SRP-database file (as
specified in lundftpd.conf) with safe permissions.
