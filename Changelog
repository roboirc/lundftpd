1.3a    * Implemented an internal "ls" routine which can be chosen to be used
	* instead of exec'ing /bin/ls. This means showing fakeusernames 
	* (useridstart is set) is easier, and cleaner. However switches to
	* the internal ``ls'' are only that of -t -S -r and -R. Also added
	* pattern matching as support. (Those were the features my users most
	* wanted.)
	* Added a usesoftchroot for the root users so that it doesn't call
	* chroot() but uses the software chroot instead. This is considerably

	* tree.

	* + UF_STAT|UF_KICK|UF_OVERWRITE|UF_DELETE|UF_DIRDELETE have been
	* + implemented so far. (and UF_NONE|UF_ALL ofcourse)
	* Added -x switch which outputs all users in a format that can
	* + be used to recreate the userbase again. e.g. lundftpd -x > backup
	* + and lundftpd -a < backup. It's not recommended to use this on
