# LION VERSION!!

This document is not quite up to date with the lion version of lundftpd, but
you have at least managed to grab the right version of lundftpd.

If you read this, you have probably managed to check out the latest
version from CVS, this is a good start. Directories of interest:

./lundftpd/
./lundftpd/src/     - the main FTPD sources, example .conf etc.
./lundftpd/misc/    - diskcull util, example sh scripts and sitecust scripts.
./lundftpd/lion/    - lion sources with lundftpd.
./lundftpd/eyot/    - small ircbot code that comes with lundftpd.
./lundftpd/win32/   - MSVC++ v6 project files for Windows.


*) Step 0. 

Getting sources from CVS:

# cvs -d ":pserver:anoncvs@lundman.net:/home/cvsroot" login
The anonymous password is "anoncvs".

# cvs -d ":pserver:anoncvs@lundman.net:/home/cvsroot" checkout lundftpd




*) Step 1.

# cd lundftpd/src/
# ls Makefile*

Pick the make file for your operating system. The default one is for
NetBSD and most sane Posix Unix boxes. If you want to change to a
different Makefile, for example Makefile.sunos:

# rm Makefile
# ln -s Makefile.sunos Makefile


*) Step 2.

# make

It required gnumake, which could be called "make", "gmake" or
"gnumake" on your system.

Lundftpd-3.03 (time of writing) is binary compatible with v2.12 data files with
the exception of groups file. The lundftpd.conf is completely new however.


*) Step 3.

You can now copy the binary executable "./lundftpd/src/lundftpd" and
example configuration file "lundftpd.conf" to a desired location, or
test it where it is. Either is fine.

Edit your lundftpd.conf.  But I would recommend only changing items as
port and paths. 

The default "lundftpd.conf" assumes you use "ftp-data/" as a
subdirectory from where you start lundftpd to store its data
files. You will need to create it, and "ftp-logs".

# mkdir ftp-data
# mkdir ftp-logs

*) Step 4.

Create yourself of at least one login (presumably with admin
privileges).

# ./lundftpd -a

You can give it privilege of "UF_ALL". Then you can do all other
administrations with "SITE" commands.



*) Step 5.

Start lundftpd. The first time it can be handy to start it with
logging on.

# ./lundftpd -v

This way you can spot any issues it might have on your system. Hit ^C
to exit it, and to run it properly in the background, use:

# ./lundftpd

Remember to start lundftpd in the directory where ftp-data/ is!


*) Step 6.

Login, and look around. Tweak your "lundftpd.conf" until you are
happy. When lundftpd is running, you will notice it is three
processes. (Unless you have increased the number of dirlist child
helpers). To stop lundftpd, you can just send "INT" to the main
one. (Generally the process with the lowest <pid>)

# kill -INT <pid>

Or perhaps:
# pkill -INT lundftpd

INT tells it to cleanly finish, let the checker child save its list of
entries to test and exit. If you HUP it, or use -9, the checker child
will just exit, and if there were files to test in the queue, they
will not be tested. (Unless you use "SITE RESCAN" to re-issue those
missed entries).



Good luck!




# USAGE

	To list help,
	        lundftpd -h

	To create a user/users,
		lundftpd -a

	To delete a user/users,
		lundftpd -d

	To edit a user/users,
		lundftpd -e
	        Note that the EDITOR variable has to be set.
	        I.e. 'setenv EDITOR vi' or maybe 'export EDITOR=vi'

	To list a user/users,
		lundftpd -l

	To start ftpd in verbose mode (don't go daemon),
		lundftpd -v

	To dump users into a form which can be used to recreate database,
		lundftpd -x > dump.txt

	To recreate user database from dump,
		lundftpd -a < dump.txt

	To load alternative configfile,
	        lundftpd -f <file>


	To list entries in dupe-database,
	        lundftpd -p <file>
	        Note that wildcards are allowed.









# COMPILE TIME SWITCHES  These are in the Makefiles.

	DIRBOT:
	  Include sources to enable sending of announces to an irc bot.

    RACESTATS:
	  Include sources to enable racestats, both for announces, and for
      detailed reports stored in ".message". Includes number of users,
      time it took, speed and size uploaded for each entry.

	POSIX:
	  If set, lundftpd tries to set the max number of open file descriptors
	  to that of the system maximum as opposed to user maximum.

	LINUX:
	  For compilation on LINUX systems which don't support proper POSIX
	  calls.

	IRIX:
	  IRIX Specific code.

	SUNOS:
	  SunOS & Solaris specific code.

	AMIGA:
	  Amiga Specific code.

	DUPECHECK
	  Enable dupecheck

	USE_NDBM:
	  Use NDBM database system.

	USE_GDBM:
	   Use GDBM database system (linux common).

	SPECIAL_CAP_ON_HOUR=<hour>
       Compile time hack to enable the capping code at a certain hour
of the day. Set this to "22" to mean "turn on at 22:00".

	SPECIAL_CAP_OFF_HOUR=<hour>
       Compile time hack to enable the capping code at a certain hour
of the day. Set this to "19" to mean "turn off at 19:00".
