V1.0

There is a new mode USESETUID which will, if the executable is setuid
to root, run as a non-priviledged user except for chown'ing files and
directories to the real users. For the real user names to show up as
their induvidual user names, the FTPD now creates a dummy etc/passwd
file (int he FTPD directory tree, not in the actual /etc) on add,
delete and edit of users. 

The first argument to usersetuid is a displacement value for
determining each users ID, this should be set outside of real users on
the system, and because of that I had made sure it has to be atleast
over 100.

Files and directories are then chowned to the respective user ID, and
files and directories 'owned' by a user can be deleted.



To install lundftpd to run under root (if you want a secure system).

if usechroot is "/your/path/ftp/"

/your/path/ftp/             ;Owned by root, mode 555 (Important!)
               etc          ;Mode 555
               bin          ;Mode 555
               bin/ls       ;cp /bin/ls to there, mode 111
               pub          ;or similarly named, any mode you want.
