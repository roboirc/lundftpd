This file is left from the v2.12 days before LiON version. It is just left 
in case it has some reference use later on. It is vastly out of date.

=== DEBUG =====================================================================

Hello Alpha Testers,

If you would like to help me track down the bugs that exist in LundFTPD
make sure you compile it with "-g", have the program "gdb" on your machine
and whenever a core file appears in the lundftpd directory type
"gdb -c lundftpd.core lundftpd" and email me the output to
lundman@argonaut.com.

It should look something like:

Core was generated by `assert'.
Program terminated with signal 11, Segmentation fault.
Reading symbols from /usr/libexec/ld.so...done.
Reading symbols from /usr/lib/libc.so.12.3...done.
#0  0x17ad in main () at assert.c:19
19        *r = 2;
(gdb)

Thanks

=== ENCRYPTION ================================================================

It has been suggested I add encryption of files, scrambling of
filenames/directory names. 

This would be done by a remote program and a file on the remote machine
containing a key. You start the ftpd which is then diabled and unable
to read files, or do file listings.  The admin, or trusted users, runs
the remote program from a remote machine which connects and enables 
the ftpd so it can decrypt files and so on.

What does people think?


===============================================================================
=== ROOT ======================================================================

V1.0

There is a new mode USESETUID which will, if the executable is setuid
to root, run as a non-priviledged user except for chown'ing files and
directories to the real users. For the real user names to show up as
their induvidual user names, the FTPD now creates a dummy etc/passwd
file (int he FTPD directory tree, not in the actual /etc) on add,
delete and edit of users. 

The first argument to usersetuid is a displacement value for
determining each users ID, this should be set outside of real users on
the system, and because of that I had made sure it has to be atleast
over 100.

Files and directories are then chowned to the respective user ID, and
files and directories 'owned' by a user can be deleted.



To install lundftpd to run under root (if you want a secure system).

if usechroot is "/your/path/ftp/"

/your/path/ftp/             ;Owned by root, mode 555 (Important!)
               etc          ;Mode 555
               bin          ;Mode 555
               bin/ls       ;cp /bin/ls to there, mode 111
               pub          ;or similarly named, any mode you want.
